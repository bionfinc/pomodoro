## Setting SECRET_KEY environment variable
### Generating secret keys
1. `$ python -m pip install Django`
1. `$ python3`
1. `from django.utils.crypto import get_random_string`
1. `chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)'`
1. `SECRET_KEY = get_random_string(50, chars)`
1. `print(SECRET_KEY)`
1. `exit()`

### Add SECRET_KEY environment variable
#### bash/zsh(macOS)
1. Open terminal
2. `$ export SECRET_KEY='[value]'` (replacing [value] with the secret key you are using)

## Database
### Adding new database models
1. Add a class to the models.py file in the app
1. If the app is not already listed under the INSTALLED_APPS section of the settings.py file, add it there
1. `$ python3 manage.py makemigrations [app name]`
1. You should get an output siimlar to `[app name]/migrations/0003_auto_20200712_1548.py`
1. `$ python3 manage.py sqlmigrate [app name] [migration number]` (migration number in the above step is shown as '0003')
1. `$ python3 manage.py migrate`

### Updating existing database models
The below steps will need to be made in the Heroku CLI once the changes have been deployed to Heroku
1. `$ python3 manage.py makemigrations [app name]`
1. You should get an output siimlar to `[app name]/migrations/0003_auto_20200712_1548.py`
1. `$ python3 manage.py sqlmigrate [app name] [migration number]` (migration number in the above step is shown as '0003')
1. `$ python3 manage.py migrate`
1. If you were in the python shell when the updates were made, then run `exit()`

### Changing the name displayed for database model rows
1. Navigate to the models.py file in the app
1. Under the table (class) you would like to modify add a `def __str__(self):` function definition
1. In that function definition return the value that you would like to see. Example: `return self.username`

`$ python3 manage.py shell`

#### To import a table
`from [app name].models import [model name]`

#### To display data in table

`[model name].objects.all()`

Display primary key for object: 

`[object name].pk` 

or 

`[object name].id`

#### To add data to a table
1. `[desired object name] = [model name]([attribute1]=[attribute1 value], [attribute2]=[attribute2 value], etc.)`
1. `[obect name from above step].save()`
